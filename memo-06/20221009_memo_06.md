# Memo 06 - Chapter 10 Agile Estimation: The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly

Proper estimations bases on appropriate expectations; for, one to complete or
be assigned work proper time, budget, and output are assessed and communicated.
As simple as that may seem accurate and effective communication are, more
often than not, an illusion that such a communication had taken place.

And so we are troubled with evaluating estimations and the complex calculated
decisions and calculations that goes behind it to give the illusion that
achievable points of progress and/or deadlines are made. Many models have been
thought up and devised to do so and have come to pass in favor for the Agile
methodology presents.

The Agile methodology presents that one should evaluate good quality work by
a team's velocity: a team's ability to execute a number of tasks in a given
time frame (a sprint).

That the team should learn to estimate with relative sizing be it a team member's
ability to complete the task according to their skill sets, the duration of
a sprint, the priority given in a set of features implemented or bugs to be fixed.
