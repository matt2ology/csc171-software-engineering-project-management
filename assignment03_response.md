## Question 01: A team completed 5 user stories in 3, 4, 3, 4, 2 days, respectively. The average cycle time is

Round up your result with one decimal point.

>A team completed 5 user stories in 3, 4, 3, 4, 2 days, respectively.
>The average cycle time is `3.2`.

## Question 02: A team uses a flow-based agile approach.  Given a project has 15 stories and the team's average cycle time is 3 days per story, the team needs a total of

>A team uses a flow-based agile approach.  Given a project has 15 stories and
>the team's average cycle time is 3 days per story, the team needs a total of
>`45` days to finish the project.

## Question 03

Given the average-case and worst-case estimates for 10 user stories,
(3, 13), (2, 2), (2, 13), (1, 8), (2, 5), (2, 2), (1, 2), (3, 13), (1, 8), (1, 13),
use the two schedule buffer approaches discussed on slides 34-35 in Module 5,
answer the following questions.  For buffer size, project total, and number of
iterations, round up your answer to a whole number.
Assuming the team's average velocity is 10.

>Using approach 1, the buffer size is `24`, the project total is `42`, and
>the number of iterations is `5`. Using approach 2, the buffer size is `9`,
>the project total is `27`, and the number of iterations is `3`.

## Question 04

User 1 : (Like, Dislike), User 2 : (Expect, Dislike), User 3 : (Like, Dislike), User 4 : (Like, Dislike), User 5 : (Like, Dislike),

User 6 : (Expect, Dislike), User 7 : (Expect, Dislike), User 8 : (Expect, Dislike), User 9 : (Expect, Dislike), User 10: (Like, Dislike)

The above data shows  Kano model survey responses for a feature, where User id: (a1, a2)
represents answers to functional and dysfunctional questions from the user with that id.
For example, User 1: (Like, Dislike) means the user with id 1 answered "Like"
for functional question and "Dislike" for dysfunctional question.

Use the method discussed on slides 8-10 in Module 6, provide the distribution
of the results and round up each percentage number to a whole number

>M is `20`, L is `10`, E is `40`, R is `0`, Q is `0`, and I is `30`.
>The feature is in the `Exciter` category.

## Relative Weighting Method

| Feature   | Relative Benefit | Relative Penalty | Total Value | Value % | Estimate | Cost % | Priority |
| :-------- | :--------------- | :--------------- | :---------- | :------ | :------- | :----- | :------- |
| Feature 1 | 6                | 2                |             |         | 40       |        |          |
| Feature 2 | 7                | 5                |             |         | 8        |        |          |
| Feature 3 | 6                | 1                |             |         | 9        |        |          |
| **Total** |                  |                  |             | 100     |          | 100    |          |

Use the Relative Weighting method to provide the missing data in the above table. For Value%, Cost%,and Priority, round the value with 2 decimal points. For instance, 2.515 should be rounded to 2.52, and 2.514 should be rounded to 2.51.

### Question 05: For Feature 1

For Feature 1

>total value is `8`,
>Value % is `29.63`,
>Cost % is `70.18`,
>and Priority is `0.42`.

### Question 06: For Feature 2

For Feature 2

>total value is `12`,
>Value % is `44.44`,
>Cost % is `14.04`,
>and Priority is `3.17`.

### Question 07: For Feature 3

For Feature 3

>total value is `7`,
>Value % is `25.94`,
>Cost % is `___`,
>and Priority is `1.64`.

### Question 08

>Feature 1 -> `3`
>
>Feature 2 -> `1`
>
>Feature 3 -> `2`
