# Memo 08 - Chapter 8 and 12 (Visualize your work with a board and Agile Team Measurements)

Team synchrony and work trackers have always been an issue in measuring if or
how work is done. One may go about this via a ticketing approach where
all efforts, comments, and references are made in the corresponding ticket,
but that hides relative visibility to how much work an employee is taking on,
that status of each effort, and each employee would have to manually investigate
or check-up with the employee.

A solution may be a board (or dashboard depending if you're using some software)
where each story owned by the employee is tracked by categorical buckets like
"backlogged", "in-progress", "blocked/holds", "reviewed", and "completed".

Having this provides a high level visibility to all work tasks given to the team,
but from my experience it's just more work to have to do than actually getting 
the work done; for, if it is a physical board than software that does it for you
is a more work for you to do in addition to the work that matters and actually
contribute to the efforts and goals of the project.

As in chapter 12 Agile Team Measurements is more art than science, although we
have derived ways in formulating metrics and functions to calculate either the
team's or an individual capability to take on a certain number of task to their
ability to output, it's not always a blanket solution for all situations.

Teams, like the individuals that form them, are unique and scenarios that they
are placed in are challenging in their own ways. A new team starting on a new
technology or project will not have any true ability to measure if their metrics
are "appropriately calibrated" they'll need some time to gather and conduct 
analysis of a general trend.
