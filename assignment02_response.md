## 21. A Scrum team created a Sprint backlog with 6 user stories, and their estimations are  8, 5, 2, 5, 3, 5.  At the end of the Sprint, the team completed all the user stories except the first one.  The team's velocity for that sprint is

A Scrum team created a Sprint backlog with 6 user stories, and their
estimations are  8, 5, 2, 5, 3, 5.  At the end of the Sprint, the team
completed all the user stories except the first one.

The team's velocity for that sprint is [20]

> Velocity is how fast you go though the points...
> Velocity is at least 20

## 22. QUESTION 22

A team is planning for a feature-driven project to include 20 user stories with
the following estimates in story points [20, 2, 3, 2, 5, 8, 5, 13, 3, 3, 20, 3,
8, 20, 13, 5, 13, 3, 5, 8].

The team's average velocity is 12 story points.  The total story points for the
project is [162] story points, and [14] iterations are needed for the
project.

Round up your iteration result to a whole number.

> if there is 50 SP then 5 iterations, if it's 48 SP then 4 iterations
> StoryPoints/Velocity = Iterations (Rounded up)

## 23. QUESTION 23

A team is planning for a date-driven projects.  The team's expected velocity
is 8 story points, the project has 10 iterations, and the following shows the
story points of user stories in priority order:

|US1|US2|US3|US4|US5|US6|US7|US8|US9|US10|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|--- |
|2|8|1|3|5|3|5|13|5|5

|US11|US12|US13|US14|US15|US16|US17|US18|US19|US20|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|5|8|13|13|8|8|1|5|3|5|

User stories from US [1] to US [13] (inclusive) should be
included for the project.
