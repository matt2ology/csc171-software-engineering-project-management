## 3. A walking skeleton enables end-to-end testing

- [x] True
- [ ] False



## 4. Smaller user stories means shorter iterations

- [ ] True
- [x] False

- [ ] True
- [x] False

> Every team has different skills and abilities

## 6. Both spike and MVE require feedback from customers

- [ ] True
- [x] False

## 7. If a project's release criteria are met but there are still items in the product backlog, it is better for the team to go above and beyond to complete those extra items in the product backlog

- [ ] True
- [x] False

> Sometimes it's impossible to complete the backlog of items...

## 8. When estimating effort for user stories, it is better to use non-linear sequences

- [x] True
- [ ] False

> As story size increases, so does the the complexity

## 9. COCOMO Suite is a traditional estimation method

- [x] True
- [ ] False

> COCOMO is just an traditional estimation method...

## 10. A team can always improve its estimation accuracy by spending more time on estimating

- [ ] True
- [x] False

> There are a lot of uncertainties with user stories and can't find them all

## 11. Frequent external release enables quicker and more feedback from customers

- [x] True
- [ ] False

## 12. 2With fixed resources, if a project's scope increases, to keep the same quality goal, its duration should be increased

- [x] True
- [ ] False

> According to the Iron Triangle

>the Iron Triangle would consists of the following end points: Value – for the customer in terms of a released product or deliverable. Quality – continuous delivery of high quality and adaptive products. Constraints - the traditional scope, schedule, and cost.

## 13. If there are a lot of uncertainties associated with project requirements, a longer iteration length should be used

- [ ] True
- [x] False

## 14. With regard to product architecture, agile approaches recommend

- [ ] conducting comprehensive architecture analysis and review
- [x] evolve the architecture as the product proceeds
- [ ] big up-front design
- [ ] no up-front design



## 15. An agile team should start a project with

- [x] project vision
- [ ] risk contingency plans
- [ ] Gantt chart
- [x] product backlog

> risk contingency plans and Gantt chart are traditional approaches

## 16. Select each item applies to Scrum risk management

- [x] Scrum does not require risk logs.
- [x] Everyone in the team is responsible for identifying risks.
- [ ] The Scrum master is responsible for reducing financial risks.
- [ ] The Scrum master is responsible for reducing business risks.

> Product owners are in charge of financial risks

## 17. According to this article (<https://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/blog/what-are-story-points>), which can impact story point estimation

- [x] risks associated with the user story
- [x] Team's definition of done
- [x] complexity of the user story
- [x] scope of the user story

> Team's definition of done: Unit tests, writing of user documentation, 
> reducing technical debt...

## 18. Select each item applies to story points

- [x] It is a relative measure
- [ ] There is a linear relationship between story points and idea hours
- [x] Using story points helps to avoid seeking unwarranted precision
- [ ] It should be estimated by external experts

> Traditional approach (not agile): It should be estimated by external experts
> > All members should be involved

## 19. Select each item applies to agile project plans

- [ ] Agile managers are responsible for creating plans
- [x] There are multiple plans
- [ ] Detailed plans are recommended
- [x] Plans are updated on regular basis.

> The product owners are responsible for creating plans
>
> Detailed plans are recommended - you can't plan for all risk and problems

## 20. According to this article (<https://www.agilealliance.org/the-magic-of-small-user-stories/>), smaller user stories

- [x] Make it easier to track project progress
- [x] Promote higher team satisfaction
- [x] Reduce velocity variability
- [ ] Improve product quality

> Not necessarily improving product quality is just a side effect

## 21. A Scrum team created a Sprint backlog with 6 user stories, and their estimations are  8, 5, 2, 5, 3, 5.  At the end of the Sprint, the team completed all the user stories except the first one.  The team's velocity for that sprint is

A Scrum team created a Sprint backlog with 6 user stories, and their
estimations are  8, 5, 2, 5, 3, 5.  At the end of the Sprint, the team
completed all the user stories except the first one.

> The team's velocity for that sprint is [20]
> > you only count completed stories

## 22. QUESTION 22

A team is planning for a feature-driven project to include 20 user stories with
the following estimates in story points [20, 2, 3, 2, 5, 8, 5, 13, 3, 3, 20, 3,
8, 20, 13, 5, 13, 3, 5, 8].

The team's average velocity is 12 story points.

Round up your iteration result to a whole number.

> The total story points for the project is [162] story points, and [14]
> iterations are needed for the project.
> > StoryPoints/Velocity = Iterations (Rounded up)


## 23. QUESTION 23

|US1|US2|US3|US4|US5|US6|US7|US8|US9|US10|

|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|5|8|13|13|8|8|1|5|3|5|

User stories from US [1] to US [13] (inclusive) should be included for the project.
