# Matthew Mendoza - Chapter 5: Start Your Agile Project Right

W38.7 | Sunday, September 25, 2022 | 08:28 PM

Starting any project is a tall order; for, there are a lot of factors one must
consider from troubleshooting key issues, risks (financial and business) involved,
and allocate appropriate resources. Different from most project management
guides/manifestos in past - Agile incorporates a lean mentality: Respect for
people and continuous improvement.

In, Johanna Rothman's "Create Your Successful Agile Project: Collaborate,
Measure, Estimate, Deliver", Start Your Agile Project Right, he instructs one
to "charter your project" it tells the team embers why they are delivering
a particular set of features, "the vision", and how they are done within the project
"the project criteria".

This is important because for a team to be functional they must understand the
impact that will be made as a result of their efforts and collaboration. One
can make the analogy to a pirate ship, her capitan, and her crew. The pirate
capitan must inform the crew to a goal, the risks involved, and potential outcomes.
A pirate ship not alined with the capitan will become un-orderly, unmotivated,
and fend for themselves than to work together in a collaborative team effort.
